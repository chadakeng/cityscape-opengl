# Solar System Simulation

This project is an interactive 3D solar system simulation built using **OpenGL** and **GLFW**. It features realistic planet rotations, orbiting mechanics, textured planets, and gamma-corrected rendering.

## Features

- **Realistic Planetary Motions**: Each planet rotates and orbits with accurate speeds and axial tilts.
- **Textured Planets**: High-quality textures bring planetary surfaces to life.
- **Gamma-Corrected Rendering**: Ensures vibrant visuals with realistic lighting.
- **Dynamic Sun Effects**: The sun features a "boiling" texture animation to mimic solar activity.

## Movements

Use the following controls to navigate the solar system:
- **W, A, S, D**: Move forward, left, backward, and right.
- **Shift**: Move downward.
- **Space**: Move upward.

## Tools Used

- **OpenGL**: Rendering and graphics pipeline.
- **GLFW**: Window and input handling.
- **GLM**: Mathematics library for transformations.
- **stb_image.h**: Texture loading.
